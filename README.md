## 2) How It Works

* **Overview banner**

  * Flow diagram: Kiosk → Queue → “Table ready” SMS → Y/N → Assign/Reassign → Analytics.
* **Detailed steps (sections matching your spec)**

  1. **Restaurant setup**: tables, capacity, branding, prefs.
  2. **Guest self check-in**: party size, name, mobile; instant SMS confirmation.
  3. **Automated notifications**: “Your table is ready. Arrive within 15 mins.”
  4. **Smart follow-up (7-min nudge)**: if no reply, reminder.
  5. **Two-way logic**:

     * Y = reserve for grace period
     * N / no reply = reassign, queue updates in real time
  6. **Dashboards**: staff updates, live metrics, table statuses.
* **Role-based views**

  * **Guests**: check-in, status link, ETA updates.
  * **Hosts/Staff**: compact queue view on mobile, “Seat,” “No-show,” “Bump.”
  * **Managers**: analytics, staffing insights, peak times, cancellations.
  * **Super Admin**: multi-restaurant governance (read-only teaser with “Restricted” badge).
* **Video walkthrough** (2–3 minutes)
